# Neural network architecture## AboutThese files provide a simple architecture to create a deep learning network. The dataset used is generated manually and consist in pairs of values in the form of points. They can be labelled as outside a circle (1) or outside (0). The network implemented aims to classify these points and correctly predict their class.## Files providesHere is a list of the files and what they contain:- test.py	- All modules	- Network composed of input layers of size 2, 3 hidden layers of size 25 and an output layer of size 2	- Main- generate_sets.py	- Generation of datasets- plot.py	- Necessary plotting functions for loss and accuracy- framework_pytorch.py	- A simple *pytorch* architecture to compare our model with- utility.py	- Error computation	- Conversion to one hot labels	- Activation functions	- Loss## How to useTo use this architecture, simply run the file test.py in the terminal as follow:```python test.py ```Two figures are given in output: the loss and accuracy of the *pytorch* architecture, then its comparison with this architecture
